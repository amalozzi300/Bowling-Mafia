    <h1>Wednesday Night Side Pots</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Attention:</strong> 
      Due to the rapid growth of the sidepots, there was a need to hire extra staff to keep
      things running smoothly. This combined with compensation for time spent on website maintenance
      and future improvements have led us to make the decision to begin charging a 10% service fee. The cost 
      of the sidepots will not be increasing, but $10 out of every $100 in each prize fund will be taken out
      to help fund this growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The addition of a service fee allows us to begin accepting Venmo and CashApp as forms of payment!
